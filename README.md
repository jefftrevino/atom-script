# Script

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/rgbkrk/atom-script.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/rgbkrk/atom-script)

This is a utility fork of the script package that doesn't contain any activation functions and loads on window startup instead upon activation, so that its services will be provided when consumed by another package. This fork will increase Atom's load time; instead, if possible, use the original [atom-script](https://atom.io/packages/script) package.
